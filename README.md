This is To Do App project made with react-redux .
Redux is used for state management.

I have used proper folder structure for this project . 
Also installed Bootstap for css Used react vite to install react for this project With the help of this project we can add our daily task or work to do in this project to remember which task we have to do and which task we have all ready done. 
We can run this project bt cd ToDoApp and running command npm run dev I have used the state of redux globally to acces data in redux globally. Its most challenging task to use redux for state management.
